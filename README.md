# Project2-jquery

A jquery project we made at one third of the course. The idea is to present crypto currencies, you can select up to 5 and then see a live graph of their values in dollar. 
The only issue is that the site that provides the values for the chart is different than the one we take the currencies from and sometimes currencies that exist on the first site do not on the second one.
